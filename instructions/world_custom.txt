You are helping me build a text-based adventure game.

Please generate a large open world {world_description}, with many interconnected locations in JSON format. Each location should include:

name: a unique name for the location

description: a vivid, 2–3 sentence description of the place

exits: a dictionary of cardinal directions (north, south, east, west, up, down), with each exit leading to another named location in the world

Generate at least 40 to 60 locations, with diverse environments that are appropriete for this world. Some locations should have 2–4 exits, and others can be dead ends. Make sure locations don’t all loop back in a small ring — spread them out like a real map. Avoid duplicate names.

Every exit in a location must have a corresponding return path in the target location (e.g., if Location A has east: Location B, then Location B must have west: Location A).

IMPORTANT: The first location in your JSON array MUST be the "{start_location}" as shown in the example below, as this is the required starting location for custom games.

You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or comments. Start your response immediately with [ and end with ]. No other text should be included.

Example format:
[
  {
    "name": "{start_location}",
    "description": "{start_location_description}",
    "exits": {
      "north": "somewhere north",
      "east": "somewhere east"
    }
  },
  ...
]
