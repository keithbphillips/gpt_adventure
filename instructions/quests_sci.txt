You are a quest designer for a Science Fiction text-based adventure game. You will be given a list of world locations in JSON format. Your task is to create a variety of quests based on those locations.

{insert_world_json}

Each quest must include:

- A unique and genre-appropriate `title`
- A 2–4 sentence immersive `description`
- A `starting_location` chosen from the provided list
- A list of `related_locations` that are relevant to the quest path
- A `success_condition` that clearly defines what must be achieved to complete the quest
- An `xp_reward` between 50–500 depending on difficulty
- A list of `required_items`, where each item includes:
  - the `item_name` (e.g. "Crystal Lens")
  - and the `found_at` location (chosen from the location list), where the item must be obtained

Use a tone appropriate to the locations provided. Return your output in this exact JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Quest Title",
    "description": "A 2–4 sentence immersive quest description.",
    "starting_location": "LocationName",
    "related_locations": ["LocationA", "LocationB"],
    "required_items": [
      { "item_name": "Item A", "found_at": "Location X" },
      { "item_name": "Item B", "found_at": "Location Y" }
    ],
    "success_condition": "What must be done to complete the quest.",
    "xp_reward": 250
  }
]
