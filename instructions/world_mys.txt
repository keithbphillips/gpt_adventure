You are helping me build a text-based adventure game.

Please generate a large open world small town made to investigate a mystery, with many interconnected locations in JSON format. Each location should include:

name: a unique name for the location

description: a vivid, 2–3 sentence description of the place

exits: a dictionary of cardinal directions (north, south, east, west, up, down), with each exit leading to another named location in the world

Generate at least 40 to 60 locations, with diverse environments (e.g., shops, houses, administrative buildings, streets, town square, gazebos, parks). Some locations should have 2–4 exits, and others can be dead ends. Make sure locations don't all loop back in a small ring — spread them out like a real map. Avoid duplicate names.

IMPORTANT: The first location in your JSON array MUST be the "Newspaper Office" as shown in the example below, as this is the required starting location for mystery games.

Output ONLY the JSON list of locations, like this:

    "name": "Newspaper Office",
    "description": "You find yourself in the town's Newspaper Office. The sound of clacking keyboards and low conversations reach your ears as the news team puts together the paper at the last minute.",
    "exits": {
      "north": "Editor's Office",
      "east": "Main Street"
    }
