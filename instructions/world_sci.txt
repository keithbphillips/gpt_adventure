You are helping me build a text-based adventure game.

Please generate a large open world science fiction  world, with many interconnected locations in JSON format. Each location should include:

name: a unique name for the location

description: a vivid, 2–3 sentence description of the place

exits: a dictionary of cardinal directions (north, south, east, west, up, down), with each exit leading to another named location in the world

Generate at least 40 to 60 locations, with diverse environments (e.g., space stations, space ships, alien worlds, strange places). Some locations should have 2–4 exits, and others can be dead ends. Make sure locations don't all loop back in a small ring — spread them out like a real map. Avoid duplicate names.

Every exit in a location must have a corresponding return path in the target location (e.g., if Location A has east: Location B, then Location B must have west: Location A).

IMPORTANT: The first location in your JSON array MUST be the "Unemployment Center" as shown in the example below, as this is the required starting location for sci-fi games.

Output ONLY the JSON list of locations, like this:

  {
    "name": "Unemployment Center",
    "description": "You find yourself in the Unemployment Center. Disgruntled and unmotivated clerks sit behind the counter. Many aliens sit in uncomfortable chairs, bored and waiting for their turns.",
    "exits": {
      "north": "Job Board",
      "east": "Promenade"
    }
  },
